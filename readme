HW2 Questions:
To answer question 3: I still need to modify login() correctly, have better exception handling, and add Serialization to my
library management system in order to get it function properly. I also need to understand how Date works and set the due dates correctly,
and implement them for each User subclass to properly reflect the requirements in homework 1.

HW3 Questions:
The implementation of a search Strategy design pattern enables one to add and define as many algorithms for a search as needed,
and simply select a concrete strategy based on user input at runtime. That way you can decouple the logic from its use.
In addition to a Strategy design pattern, a Singleton pattern was also used to ensure that only one instance of Library
would ever be created. By making the Library constructor private, this enforces a stronger design.

Serializable is still not implemented, but the functionality of the program should still be intact and the data structures
should be updated when new information is added. There is a bug with Library.removeUser(): it does not find the user by name.
